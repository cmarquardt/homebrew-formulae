Homebrew formulae
=================

These formulae provide software tailored to my homebrew installation. Right now, they bundle some packages for R and python for easier installation.


How to install these formulae?
------------------------------

Just `brew tap cmarquardt/science` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, one can `brew install cmarquardt/formula/<formula>`.

One can also install via a URL:

    brew install https://raw.github.com/cmarquardt/homebrew-formulae/master/<formula>.rb
